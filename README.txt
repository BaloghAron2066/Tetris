This is a simple implementation of the classic tetris game.

My goal was to practice the usage of classes and OOP in python, aldough I did not use specific design patterns.

I only used Pygame library other than built in libraries.
I did not use any method of Pygame other than the essetial ones (creating display, creating rectangles...).
That is because my goal was to practice OOP and not to practice Pygame.

How to run the program:
  1: Download all the files, and put them in the same folder.
  2: You can run it with main.exe or main.py if you have python installed.
