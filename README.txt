This is a simple implementation of the classic tetris game.

My goal was to practice the usage of classes and OOP in python, aldough I did not use specific design patterns.

To run the program:
  1: Download all the files, and put then in the same folder.
  2: You can run it with main.exe or main.py if you have python installed.
